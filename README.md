# NFT_auction

This program provides an easy and secure way to buy and list NFTs on the blockchain in an online auction house setting.  NFT buyers get a unique oppourtunity to view digital art that they may have never seen otherwise, as well as get a sense of the demand or interest for a particular piece of art that they may have their eyes on.  NFT sellers have an easy way to list an assets they are looking to liquidate.  Their art is likely to have many eyes from interested buyers on it and is likely to be sold at a fair market value, given the nature of the open auction system.  Our program is essentially divided into three distinct parts:  A submission screen for interested sellers to list their digital art, a bidding screen for buyers to bid on the NFT listed for sale, and an approval screen to finalize the transaction.  Below are videos demonstrating a detailed use case for both buyers and sellers on the auction house.  The videos also serve as examples for what your future NFT buying/seller experince will look like.
